All In,Displace,Drive,All In - Displace.pdf,---,Displace,Friday,3:40,Home Team,"Austin on Trombone, Bianca on Bari Sax part, Brian on Trumpet 2 part (if he's there)"
Friction,Displace,Spotify,,Brian,Displace,Friday,3:40,Home Team,"No charts for ""Friction"" unfortunately but we can jam on that one. The only notable section would be the bridge hits at 2:40 then the horn feature at 3:05 and the very last hit of the song. Other than that, y'all can ""do you"" on it! "
Blinding Lights,The Weeknd,Spotify,,,Displace,Friday,3:40,Home Team,"For ""Blinding Lights"" we play it pretty big. We do it instrumentally with our singer playing it on Keytar. Maybe a big horn swell at the beginning and you guys blast the main melody. We're down for suggestions too but we stick to the form as the original. We are in the original key |Fm - Cm - Eb - Bb|"
